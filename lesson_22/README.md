### Working with CSS Instructions

You will have the opportunity to develop your CSS skills by attempting to mimic a simplified version of the Code Differently website.

1. Make a copy of the template directory and give it a unique name.
2. Add your CSS to the `style.css` file in the directory.
3. Submit a PR with your completed solution. You should only make modifications to the CSS file while leaving the other copies unmodified.
