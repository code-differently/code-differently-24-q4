### Introduction to React
This exercise will give you hands-on experience with the React framework and supporting tools to enhance a dynamic front-end application that communicates with a backend API.

#### Starting the servers

1. Copy the React [template](./template/) folder to your own unique folder. Make necessary code changes in your folder only. 
2. Install the React web server in your copy using `npm install` and then run it using the `npm run dev` command.

#### Create new components
3. Modify the [Home](./template/src/pages/Home/Home.tsx) component to create new `Program` and `ProgramList` components. The needed HTML and CSS has already been provided for you.
  - The `Program` component should allow you to configure the title and description to display.

#### Create a page for adding new programs

4. Create a new page (similar to the Home page component) that allows users to provide a new program title and description in a form.
