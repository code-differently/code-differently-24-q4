# Capstone Project

For the next two weeks, you and your team will ideate and implement a working software system. You will have the opportunity to apply the skills that you have learned to solve an interesting problem or contribute a meaningful tool that improves our lives.

### Changelog
- 12/4 @anthonydmays Updated technical requirement for number of PRs submitted per teammate.
- 12/2 @anthonydmays Published initial version

### Technical Requirements

Your project submission must include the following elements:

* All work must be submitted in your team's assigned GitHub repository. Your team must track issues, bugs, pull requests, and features. See [Lesson 05][lesson-05] for a refresh.
* Each team member must contribute *at least two* submitted pull requests containing working code and tests. See [Lesson 15][lesson-15] for a refresh.
* Write unit tests achieving 70% code coverage (using JaCoCo for Java or Jest for Typescript).
* Must have a working front-end that interacts with a back-end web service to retrieve and persist data.
* Your app must be publicly accessible. It is recommended that you use [Vercel](https://vercel.com) or [Fly.io](https://fly.io) to deploy your apps.
* The system must incorporate one third-party API.
* Your repo must include a README with the following elements:
    * The team
    * Screenshot
    * A description of the app
    * Demo link
    * Installation instructions
    * Known issues
    * Roadmap features
    * Credits
* It is **HIGHLY** recommended that you maintain a clean `Main` branch and only merge changes via pull requests (we've been using squashed merges for the main repo to simplify commit history). Don't forget to use [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits-link].
