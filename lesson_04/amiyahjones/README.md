``` javascript

// If the number is a prime # , return true. Else = false
```


## Explanation 

My Javascript implementation uses a for loop to determine whether the number is prime. It thats a single 'if' argument on whether the number is prime. If not, then the 'else' statement will return false since it's outside of those few numbers.
