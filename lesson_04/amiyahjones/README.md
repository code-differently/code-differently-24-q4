## Javascript
``` javascript
const isPrimeNumber = [
2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,
19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41,
43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67,
71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
];

if (isPrimeNumber == true) {
  return (true);
} else {
  return false;
}
//prime number: a number that can only be divided by itself and 1 without remainders
// If the number is a prime , return true. Else = false
```


## Explanation 

My Javascript implementation uses a for loop to determine whether the number is prime. It thats a single 'if' argument on whether the number is prime. If not, then the 'else' statement will return false since it's outside of those few numbers.
