## Java Method
```java
public static boolean isPrime(int n) {
    if (n <= 1) return false;
    for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i++) {
        if (n % i == 0) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```
## Python Method
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

## Understanding The Code
Java and Python have notable similarities in their function structures, as seen in the `isPrime` (Java) method and the `is_prime`(Python) function. Both start by checking if \( n \) is less than or equal to 1, returning false if it is. They then use a for-loop to find factors from 2 up to the square root of \( n \). Although Java requires explicit type declarations and Python does not, their logical flow remains quite similar. This demonstrates their focus on clarity and structure, making both languages user-friendly and accessible for developers of all skill levels.

## Differences
Java and Python differ significantly in syntax and structure, as seen in the `isPrime` method and the `is_prime` function. Java is a statically typed language, requiring explicit type declarations, such as `int n`, whereas Python is dynamically typed, allowing variables to be defined without a type. Additionally, Java uses the `Math.sqrt` method to calculate the square root, while Python employs the expression `n**0.5`. The for-loop syntax also varies: Java uses a traditional for-loop with an initializer, while Python utilizes the `range` function. These differences illustrate the distinct design philosophies and readability approaches of each language.
