## Java Implementation

```java

public static void main(String[] args){

    System.out.println(isEven(4)); // Output: true
    System.out.println(isEven(7)); // Output: false

}

public static boolean isEven(int number){
    return (number % 2 == 0);
}


```

## Python Implementation

```python

def is_even(number: int) -> int:
    return number % 2 == 0

print(is_even(4))  # Output: true
print(is_even(7))  # Output: false

```

## Explanation

The Java implementation uses a method called `isEven` that takes a single parameter called number. The method returns `true` if the number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0. If the quotient has a remainder of anything other than 0, the method returns `false`, indicating that the number is odd. For example, if you pass the number 4 to isEven, it will return `true` because 4 divided by 2 equals 2, with no remainder. Conversely, passing the number 5 will return `false`.

Similarly, the Python implementation uses a function called `is_even` that also takes a single parameter named number. The logic is the same as in the Java implementation: it checks whether number divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 and returns `true` or `false` accordingly.

### Differences
1. **Types**:

    - One key difference between Java and Python lies in how they handle types. Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you can change the type of a variable at any time. For instance, you can initially set `variable = 1` (an integer), and later change it to `variable = "2"` (a string) without any errors. Python does allow for type hints—like `def is_even(number: int) -> int:` to indicate expected types, but these hints are not enforced at runtime.

    - In contrast, Java is a strongly typed language, requiring you to explicitly declare the type of each variable. For example, when declaring a variable, you would write `int variable = 1;`. This strictness helps prevent type-related errors during compilation, providing greater reliability in larger applications.

2. **Syntax**:

    - Furthermore, the syntax for defining functions differs significantly. In Java, defining a method requires specifying an access modifier (public, private, protected, or default), followed by the return type (such as void, Object, boolean, String, int, float, or double). After that, you write the method name and the parameters, ensuring each parameter has a specified type. For example, a complete method definition might look like this:

    ```java
    public boolean isEven(int number) {
        return number % 2 == 0;
    }
    ```
    - This structured approach in Java contrasts with Python’s more straightforward syntax, where a function is defined simply with the def keyword followed by the function name and parameters.

Overall, these differences reflect the distinct philosophies of the two languages, with Java emphasizing type safety and structure, while Python prioritizes flexibility and simplicity.
