## Explanation 
My first thought was to use Javascript and html because those were the 2 languages that I was familiar with. I did some research and quickly came to the realization that html would not be the most effective. That's when I found out that I should use Python and Javascript.
Python is known for how easy it is to read and how simple it is. But is super space indentation sensitive. Whereas Javascript is a little more complex because it uses different characters, which makes it a little harder to understand.

Similarities: Both Javascript and Python are finding prime numbers between 2 and 100 even though in pyton it says 101. That is becuase we did not plug in 101 we stopped right before it.

Diffreneces: A diffrence that Javascript uses let for declaring variables while python uses simplier words becuase you do  not need a keyword
