```java

      System.out.println(checkForPrime(12)); 
    }
    
      //Start--Java program to illustrate whether the number 11 is prime or not
    static boolean checkForPrime (int n){
    int count = 0; 
    int i = 1;
    while(i <= n ) {
        if(n % i == 0){
            count = count + 1;
        } 
        i = i + 1 ;
    }
    if(count == 2) 
        return true;
    else
      return false;
    
    } 
}
```
## Above is a brief java while loop; in this loop the 'driver' is the boolean keyword, the class name 'checkForPrime' and the class declaration static (as well as public/void; not included in example). In the method section of this example, the variable n, or 12 is the argument. The count function is triggered when the remainder of n divided by some iteration of integers within the program is 0.
