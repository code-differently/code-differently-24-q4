## Homework

- [ ] Complete the [Creating a Library API](#creating-a-library-api) assignment.
- [ ] Do pre-work for [lesson 27](/lesson_27/).

### Creating a Library API

We are continuing to build atop the foundation of our library app. For this assignment, you will help implement the API that will be used by a yet-to-come front-end app.

* You will implement the [MediaItemsController][controller-file] to enable the following API:
   * `GET /items` - Retrieves a list of media items
   * `POST /items` - Creates a new media item
   * `GET /items/:id` - Retrieves a single media item with the given ID.
   * `DELETE /items/:id` - Deletes a single media item with the given ID.
* Study the tests in [MediaItemsControllerTest][controller-test-file] to understand what you should accept and return in the API.
* You should not need to make any code changes outside of the `com.codedifferently.lesson26.web` package.

#### Running the API

You can run the server using the usual `./gradlew run` command from the `api/java` directory. If you want to test that the server is running correctly, you can use `curl` like so:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/items | json_pp
```

Alternatively, you can test the API using the tool [Postman][postman-link]. I recommend installing this tool to make it easier to test things.
