## User Story #1
As a YouTube content creater, I want to be able to view the dislike counter for my video when I am in my YouTube app.
## User Story #2
As a Nintendo Switch owner, I want to be able to modify and customize what my switch looks like on the home screen. I wish it could be easy like setting a screensaver for my phone.

## User Story #3
As a Ubisoft user, I want to be able to run the program on my PC without it taking too much memory. I just want to play UNO.
