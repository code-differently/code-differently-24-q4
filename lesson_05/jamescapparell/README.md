## User Story #1
As a YouTube content creater, I want to view the dislike counter for my video when I am in my YouTube app, so I can view the dislike number without logging into my YouTube Studio app.
## User Story #2
As a Nintendo Switch owner, I want to modify and customize what my Switch looks like on the home screen, so I can easily set a screensaver similarly to my phone.

## User Story #3
As a Ubisoft user, I want to be able to run the program on my PC without it taking too much memory, so it makes it easier to run UNO on my PC as well.
