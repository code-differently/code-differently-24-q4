# Lesson 05 User Stories
## User Story 1
I am a fellow consumer of **musi** which is a music app and here are a few things I would like to see
- I want to be able to see my songs have a *history/record* to see a listening time and how many times I have played that song, so the app can recommend me songs similar to that due to constant listening or the opposite if I did not listen to that song.
- I want to distinguish the genres and categories my songs are in, so a different section in the app to show you the genres of music you have so if you did not know what genre your favorite song was then you would have no trouble in finding it and delete a whole genre if you wanted.
## User Story 2
I am the owner of an app called **Stars Of The Night**, and i have a few ideas for implemenations on my app that would make it better
- I want to be able to have my consumers interact with the constellations, so if they are looking at the sign Leo it would be traced and then you can move it around how you like and hit another constellation.
- I want to have it that even if the clouds are in the way the app will clear it up for you as long as it has your location while you use the app so that it can track where you are and give you a real time view with no obstruction.
## User Story 3
I am a frequent user of **Youtube** however the algorithm is always changing and showing me things i do not usually watch so I tried to come up with a few ideas
- I want to be able to have the algorithm change only if I like a video or save it for later.
- I want to be able to watch two things at once such as one is music and the other is a tutorial I am watching so that I can possibly focus more.
