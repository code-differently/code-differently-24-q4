## User Stories for Food Delivery
To have smooth customer food delivery experience. Here are three user story examples:
1. As a customer, I want to track my order, so I can know when to expect delivery. 
2. As a customer, I want my food to be hot, so the delivery person can use bags to make sure the food remains hot. 
3. As a online food customer, I want the ability to save my food order that I am interested in for later, so I can quick order next time if I want to.
