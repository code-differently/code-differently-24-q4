# Finding Bugs

## Dark Mode Bug
Upon clicking the dark mode button the screen didnt change color only the top bar did, not only that the bar actually made it so some of the buttons weren't able to be seen and even changed one.

## Sidebar Text Deletion
Upon clicking the sidebar and collapsing it I was greeted with more than I expected when the sidebar actually got rid of the respective text but also the tab for today's tasks seemed to have also been removed as well when collapsing the sidebar.

## Creating New Tasks
When trying to create new tasks I see that my text disappears after I press the "add task" button and only reappears when I reload the page or log back in .
