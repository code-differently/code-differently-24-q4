## User Story examples

* Being a self-proclaimed sneaker enthusiast means participating in sneaker raffles which means purchasing sneakerbots to give myself the best chance of 'landing a new pair'. I want a sneakerbot that comes with clear concise directions in the manual, recommended best practices for running proxies in that paricular bot and an encrypted activation key.

## Acceptance Criteria: 

*  A detailed yet concise usermanual, that is easy to read and informative. 
*  Provide the user with an encrypted activation key.
*  Trusted user reviews on popular sneakerbot forums such as a subreddit forum or telegram.

## User Story Example 2

*  As an avid Nike fan I want to stay up to date with the latest nike drops to stay well informed about "limited edition" releases.

## Acceptance Criteria

* Simple yet informative user interface.
* Consistent notifications from the app with detailed descriptions of products; from prices to store pickup according to user location.
* Early registration for product drop raffles

## User Story Example 3 

* Life is busy in 2024, so being able to have ready to eat food delivered to your doorstep is a lifesaver. As a food delivery app user I want to know my order is being delivered in the most efficient way possible.

## Acceptance Criteria 

*  Real time delivery updates should never have hanging load times.
*  Delivery personnal should be required to send delivery updates every five to ten minutes, and whenever possible while out on the road(at redlights/heavy traffic updates etc.).
*  Drivers should be held accountable for damaged or missing orders and should have to either lose pay through customer reimbursement or replace the order entirely; this should all be done through the app in a quick & simple fashion.
