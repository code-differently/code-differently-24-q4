## Altomated Get Dressed Machine

1. As a user of the new technology, I would like to suggest showing a picture of myself, instead of an generic person who does not represent my body type.
    This would help elevate disappointment with the end result when a particular item did not fit just right.

2. As an influencer, I would like certain products to be preloaded prior to use.
    This would help guide the shopper to the products I am promoting.

3. As a designer, I would like show how much work goes into each item that is produced.
    This would help the consumer see how much detail and percession is but into each piece that is produced.
