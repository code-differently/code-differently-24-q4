### My work hours:
I start my work day between Monday-Friday by waking up at 7am. Once I am up, I get up and get ready for the day. I leave my house by 7:45 and I have a 20 minute drive to work. I start work at 9am with a break between 11am-12pm and the work day ending at 5pm

## What’s the best way to communicate with me?
I will be mainly be communicating for work through my email: jjcapparell244@gmail.com

If I don’t respond, try my phone number on file

## I'd love to help you with making the code make sense
I try my best to explain every idea presented in my code and will make an explaination to easily understand it.

## What makes me grumpy?
I am the grumpiest when I amtrying to understand something that I am learning. If I feel like I am just not getting it, I tend to get quiet and try to force my way into figuring it out.
	
## How do I like to give feedback?
If I were to give you feedback, I think it is much easier in person. I like to first ask if you need any help with anything they are currently working on. After I am on the same page I will show what my works like and expalin how I got to where I am at and explain my thought process.

## How do I like to receive feedback?
I like my feed back in person as well. I like to see a solution with an example to reference the problem I am having. I may ask for soecifics about how that process works so I completely understand and can concieve that solution later.

## One of my goals for the coming year:
I hope that I learn all I need to know for Git Hub and Java, in order to collaberate well for future assignments

## Topics I’m always happy to talk about:
If I am ahead in a project we are working on, I like to help explain to others how I got to the point I made it to. I like explaining in full detail so others can concieve that type of result later as well.
