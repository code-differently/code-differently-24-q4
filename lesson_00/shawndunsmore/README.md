## Introduction 
In the early stages of my life I was very fascinated in how computers work and how they are built which made me want to learn more about them. Around 15 years old I was instructed step by step to build my very first computer going over each parts functions to the computer which sparked my interests even more later through my years I took up a class for coding and wanted to learn about how languages are created and the origin of how they came to be.

## Interests
Things I enjoy to do is video games, reading, watching sports, and playing football. I am a very simple person in what I like im never over the top I like to be simple and fast but apart from those things Those are a few things I enjoy.
