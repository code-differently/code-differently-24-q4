## Introduction 
In the early stages of my life I was very fascinated in how computers work and how they are built which made me want to learn more about them. Around 15 years old I was instructed step by step to build my very first computer going over each parts functions to the computer which sparked my interests even more later through my years I took up a class for coding and wanted to learn about how languages are created and the origin of how they came to be. Im happy to be in this field and can't wait to fight through my struggles people want to give up but I want to win.

## Interests
Things I enjoy to do is video games, reading, watching sports, and playing football. I am a very simple person in what I like im never over the top I like to be simple and fast but apart from that I spend my time going to bible studies I am a man of god I of course make mistakes but im not always going to be perfect but I can always do better. Also I have a thing with drama or news happening around the world I like to talk politics as well im never going to shut someones opinion down, better to hear and go from there.

## Dislikes
Now I may be simple in my likes I am also simple in my dislikes. Im not a big fan on tennis never could really get into it, don't get me wrong I love sports but tennis I never could seem to get the hand of it. Another dislike of mine is bully's if there is one thing in this world I hate it's bully's couldn't stand them then and I wont tolerate it now.
