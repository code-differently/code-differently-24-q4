## Who is Chigazo(Austin)?
My full name is Chigazo Austin Graham I was born and raised here, in Wilmington, Delaware. Growing up I was a part of various programs teaching me skills in business and technology, I even owned my own business selling hygiene products by the age of 7 and won at a business pitch competition against high school students. I graduated from Salesianum high school and during my time there I was shortly a part of the Code Differently Youth Program as a junior software engineer before departing to focus on my studies. I attended Delaware State University (DSU) with a major in computer science for a year prior to joining the Code Differently adult program to further my current software engineering skills and to begin building a career for myself. 

### Work hours & preferences(& the best way to communicate with me):
* I am NOT a morning person, but I am available to work as early at any time as long as the meeting time is discussed and agreed upon at least 24 hours before said meeting.
* I prefer chats due to ease of use but I am available for in-person meetings if properly scheduled.
* In order the most effective method of communication to me would be text message then email and finally linkedIn
