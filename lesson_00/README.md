## Homework

- [ ] Create a [personal README](#personal-readme) and [submit](#submitting-your-assignment) via GitHub.
- [ ] Do pre-work for [lesson 01](/lesson_01/).

### Personal README

A personal README is a way to teach others how to best work with you. It is useful for expressing your learning style and personal preferences, likes and dislikes.

For this exercise, you with use the `MARKDOWN` language (the language used to author this very README) to create your own personal version. Your version should incorporate __at least one picture, one list, appropriate headings, and be at least 300 words__.

For inspiration, feel free to check out the examples at [Kaeti's repo][kaeti-repo] or do your own thing. Have fun, but keep it professional!

To submit your assignment, please do the following:

1. Fork this repository (repo) under your own Github account.
1. In your forked repo, create a new branch and give it a name.
1. Add your `README.md` and accompanying picture files to a sub-folder you create under `lesson_00` (see [lesson_00/anthonymays](/lesson_00/anthonymays) for example).
1. Commit as many changes as you need to your branch and push to Github.
1. When ready to merge, visit this repo to create a pull request (PR).

If you need more help, you can check out [this page here][open-source-contributions] or watch [this YouTube video][open-source-youtube].

**Note:** If you would rather not have this README published publicly, please indicate that in your PR description and I will review it without accepting it for merge. The PR can be deleted when done. Don't delete the README however, as you'll need it for later assignments.
