## About Me
Originally born and raised in Springfield, Virginia, I started my life in the DMV area. After moving to Delaware I eventually decided to go to a Vocational Tech School where I majored in carpentry. I worked on woodworking projects including cabinets,framing, and roofing. I continued my studies in carpentry for an additional 2 years before deciding on going to Delaware tech for College. I studied accounting for a time and received my associates degree. Afterwards I entered an adult learning  program where I learned HVAC. I worked in this industry for the following 2 years before finding an interest in coding.

### Learning Style
I learn best in a social setting as I can bounce ideas across other people and receive feedback on my actions immediately. I also like to have a hands on approach on subjects and prefer getting my hands dirty with experiments and role-playing scenarios. When I'm alone i like to reflect on the work that I have done and repeat challenge exercises to build up the mental repetition in my head. I struggle to figure out how to tackle problems in the beginning but feel that it gets easier once I have built once I have a solid foundation to process my ideas.
