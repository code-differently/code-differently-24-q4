## About Me
Originally born and raised in Springfield, Virginia, I started my life in the DMV area. After moving to Delaware I eventually decided on going to a Vocational Tech School where I majored in carpentry. I worked on woodworking projects including cabinets,framing, and roofing. I continued my studies in carpentry for an additional 2 years before deciding on going to Delaware tech for College. I studied accounting for a time and received my associates degree. Afterwards I entered an adult learning  program where I learned HVAC. I worked in this industry for the following 2 years before finding an interest in coding.
