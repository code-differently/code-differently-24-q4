* Time management is big for me 
* I have to be organized in order for me to be my most productive self



# What will get me talking 

* I love talking about cheerleading. Like I said before I have been doing cheerleading since I was 3 years old. I have not stopped since. 
* I enjoy talking about clothing and shopping. I have so many clothes. I love going to the mall. I also enjoy going to the mall. I did have to take a pause on shopping because I am starting to not have anywhere to put my clothes. 
* I have torn my ACL and I love to relate to people in this way and give them encouragement on the 9 month process. I know how it feels to have to take a step back from doing things how you normally do them and having to adapt to your new life. 
* I also like to talk about cheerleading skills. I enjoy spreading my knowledge and helping people achieve skills that I already know. I get pride and joy from doing so.
