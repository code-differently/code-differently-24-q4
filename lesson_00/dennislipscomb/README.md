## The README About Nothing 😎

Dennis is a born creative at heart. His creative journey started with attending The Art Institute of Philadelphia as an audio engineer and pivoting into creating music, writing music and publishing a book of spokenword entitled HeARTwork.

## The Motivation 🙏🏽

How I like to start my day

* Iced Matcha latte or Cold Brew w/ oatmilk
* Unnecessarily loud music 
* BLT (turkey bacon only)
* 30 minutes of exercise
* Sports debate shows

 ## The Connection 🔗

I don't have a personal prefence with communication. If you have a direct way to reach me, use which ever works best for you. 

Phone calls, text, e-mail, morse code ect. Anytime of day, if im awake or not busy I'll respond asap, scouts honor.

## The Learning Style 👀 

**The Positive Way** 📈 I'm a visual learner. The best way for me to retain information is by seeing a visual demonstration or example and then repetition of practice. 

**The Negative Way** 📉 Reading with out any direction of what i'm doing makes it difficult to retain information. 


## The Feedback 🫵🏽

I prefer to receive direct feedback in a 1-on-1 setting. Don't hold any punches. Brute honesty motivates me. I may not like you in the moment but I'll appreciate it later.

On the otherhand, I tend to be soft when giving feedback. I can be very politically correct and try to protect feelings while still getting the point across.
