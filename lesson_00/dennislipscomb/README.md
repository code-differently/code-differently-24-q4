## The Into About Nothing 😎

Dennis is a born creative at heart. His creative journey started with attending The Art Institute of Philadelphia as an audio engineer and pivoting into creating music, writing music and publshing a book of spokenword entiiled HeARTwork.

## The Motivation 🙏🏽

* Iced Matcha latte or Cold Brew w/ oatmilk
* Unnecessarily loud music 
* BLT (turkey bacon only)
* 30 minutes of exercise
* Sports debate shows

 ## The Connection 🔗

I don't have a personal prefence with communication. If you have a direct way to reach me, use which ever works best for you.

## The Learning Style 👀

I'm a visual learner. The best way for me to retain information is by seeing a visual demonstration or example and then repetition of practice.

## The Feedback 🫵🏽

I prefer to receive direct feedback in a 1-on-1 setting. Don't hold any punches. Brute honesty motivates me. I may not like you in the moment but I'll appreciate it later.

On the otherhand, I tend to be soft when giving feedback. I'm very politically correct and try to protect feelings.

## The Goals 🥅

My main goal for this year is to add tech to my creative ablities in any aspect. To start my food content creator journey and to write another book.
