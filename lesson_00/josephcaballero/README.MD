# Joseph Caballero

## Introduction
My name is Joseph Caballero, I started coding two years ago and always had an interest since my introduction to it. I was born in Hawaii and grew up primarily in New Jersey before moving to Delaware when I was about 9 or 10 years old.

## Interests and Hobbys
I like to eat , sleep , and be active. 
I currently box and enjoy anything related to boxing/combat
My favorite boxers are (in no particular order) Mike Tyson , Marvin Hagler , Sugar Ray Leonard , Roberto Duran , Muhammad Ali , etc.

## Dislikes
I do not like most vegetables by themselves
I do not like competing in team sports but I do not mind watching them
I do not like traffic or anything that would delay me

## Contact
I do not have a preference between Email or phone I will respond to both
Even though i do not have a preference if it is not urgent then email would be best so I can keep tabs on things easier than if it were message

## Fun Facts

* I enjoy chinese food 
* I was born in Hawaii
