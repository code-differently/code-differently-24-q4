# Nile Jackson's README.md

## Introduction
Hi, my name is Nile Jackson. I started learning JavaScript about a month ago, and I'm about two weeks into my journey with Java; I'm new. I decided to learn programming because of my fascination with digital audio workstation plugins, and I plan on building my own in due time. Before Code Differently, I worked primarily in juvenile detention; this wasn't fulfilling, so a little over a year ago I rented a room in Brooklyn, New York, and began an audio engineering internship at a place called Jungle Studios. After two months at Jungle and several odd jobs, I landed my first "gig" as the sound guy at a local bar called Skytown. I continued working small gigs for a few months while traveling back to Delaware three times a week to do carpentry work with a longtime friend. Eventually, I decided that this lifestyle wasn't sustainable, so after another four-month internship at Manhattan Beach Studios, I did some research and discovered Code Differently.

## Likes
I enjoy cooking because I'm an eight-year vegan who misses the dishes I grew up on, namely Jamaican food; I spend a lot of downtime in the kitchen trying to "veganize" things. Other than food, I love to read. I hated books as a kid, but four or five years ago, I moved to Iowa to play (school) football at a small private college called William Penn. I wasn't a fan of Iowa or the school, so I began using the library as a place to escape. I also like my two dogs, Pico (a pit bull/Great Dane mix) and LuLu (a small mut of some sort).

## Dislikes
I'm not a fan of the following: 
- Artichokes
- English breakfast tea
- The New York subway system
- Excessively cold winters 

## Hobbies
Some of my hobbies include:
- Various forms of exercise (force of habit from a life of sport)
- Reading (right now I'm reading a book called *Cosmos and Psyche* by Richard Tarnas)
- Anime/manga (favorite anime: *Berserk*, favorite manga: *Sakamoto Days*)
- Lounging/napping with my dogs Pico and LuLu

## My Working/Learning Style
Myers-Briggs says I'm an INTP. It usually takes me some time to open up to new people (peers/coworkers), but after that, I'm pretty much an open book. I'm a visual learner who values repetition. Professionally, I'm not sure what my style is, but I'm working on that.

## My Circadian Rhythm
I'm a night owl, but I'd like to change that, as most of my nights tend to spill into days. This is also a work in progress.

## Why I Value Programming
I'm sure this will change over time, but for now, I'll say I value programming because it's empowering; I went to middle/high school for fine art because I loved making "something from nothing," and the idea of making a program stirs up that same feeling.

## Moving Forward
I look forward to learning GitHub, Git, and Docker because I don't enjoy feeling confused. I also hope I can make myself an asset to the other members of my cohort, as that would mean that I have a clue as to what's going on. My main goal here at Code Differently is to gain programming skills, get better at problem-solving, build relationships, and get a job so I can get paid to learn.
