# David Smith README.md

##  Introduction
When I was younger I spent most of my life playing video games I was fascinated by creating a world in a game that could be whatever I wanted, something to look at and share with the world being able to say I made that. I came from a very poor area and am putting in the work to better my life for myself and my future family.

## Past work
* 4 years at Code Differently I worked in the Youth Employment Program for the better part of 4 years, learning a variety of different coding languages and using multiple different frameworks.

* Three, 8 week internships at JPMorgan Chase & Co. I would expand on the projects I've worked on unfortunately because of NDA's I cannot elaborate upon this but I used several in house frameworks and platforms including cloud platform, creating servers and api's used within the firm.
 
##  The Way I Learn
I am a very hands on person. I dislike lectures but I understand why they're important because you're learning from someone elses experience and saving time rather than having to go through the experience yourself.

### Likes
* Cars; I currently drive a 2015 BMW 428 XI with a dual turbo charged engine makes about 500 HP and 770+ lbs of torque
