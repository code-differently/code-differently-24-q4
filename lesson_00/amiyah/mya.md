# Mya.README 
*I’m a young developer who just graduated from the youth development program. 
I’ve been with code differently as a jr developer intern since 2020! I’m rather new like my other coworkers - 
especially being out into the real world. <br>
The reason I joined the adult program was to update and improve my skills and web development*

### ☴ My work hours
9AM-6PM .ᐟ.ᐟ However you will most likely catch me outside of those hours if you need any help. 
When i'm out on vacation or absent, I will be offline until my return.

### What's the best way to communicate with me?
A private message through google chat works perfect. It's the fastest way to reach me! 
Email works too as a follow up or if it's what you prefer. In case I don't respond: ping me again on google chat.
A reminder as well, please don't worry or apologize about reaching out - that's my thing.
