⚠︎ .ᐟ.ᐟ "...I'm the type of person that if you ask me a question and I don't know the answer, I'm gonna tell you that I don't know. But I bet you what, I know how to find the answer and I will find the answer." - Will smith

### ☴ My work hours
<code style="color : aquamarine">9AM-5PM</code> However you will most likely catch me outside of those hours if you need any help. 
When i'm out on vacation or absent, I will be offline until my return.

### What's the best way to communicate with me? .☘︎ ݁˖
A private message through google chat works perfectly. One of the fastest ways to reach me! 
Email works too as a follow up or if that's what you prefer, either one is fine. In case I don't respond: ping me again on google chat.
A reminder as well, please don't worry or apologize about reaching out - that's my thing.
