## Introduction
I started programming when I was fairly young. I was 12 when when I was playing CS:GO when I died to a hacker in game. I obviously got frustrated but besides being mad I found an interest. I wondered how did those cheats work. So I went online and downloaded a cheat and googled a youtube tutorial on how to decipher the source code of the cheat. From there I was entranced with programming. Since I've unlocked that passion I've managed to acquire 2 separate internships at JPMorgan Chase & Co. where I worked on a multitude of backend and frontend systems.
