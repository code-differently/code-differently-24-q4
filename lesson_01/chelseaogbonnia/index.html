            <p>Hi there! I’m currently on my journey to becoming a full-stack software engineer. I enjoy solving problems and learning new technologies as I go. This README gives you a little insight into how I work best, what motivates me, and how I approach learning and collaboration.</p>

        <h2 id="how-i-learn-best">How I Learn Best</h2>
        <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Independent Learning: I prefer figuring things out on my own, and I enjoy working through challenges independently before reaching out for help. This allows me to build resilience and a deeper understanding of the material.</li>
            <li>Visual Learning: I grasp concepts more quickly when I can visualize them. Charts, diagrams, and presentations help me organize information in a way that sticks. I find that seeing a process step-by-step or looking at a flowchart helps solidify abstract concepts.</li>
            <li>Planning Ahead: I like having access to the curriculum early so I can break down topics and structure my learning schedule. When I can map out what’s ahead, I feel more in control and can manage my time better.</li>
            <li>Mastering Subjects: I work on a subject until I feel confident enough to explain it to someone else. Teaching is one of the ways I confirm my own understanding. If I can make something simple enough for others to understand, I know I’ve truly mastered it.</li>
            <li>Note-Taking: I’m not the type to take long-winded notes. Instead, my notes are an organized summary of my thoughts. They serve as a reference point for later, but I tend to work through most concepts in my head first before writing anything down.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="what-i-value-in-collaboration">What I Value in Collaboration</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Clear Communication: I appreciate clear, concise communication, especially in code reviews or when getting feedback. I respond well to messages that are to the point, with direct and actionable suggestions.</li>
            <li>Respect for Work Styles: I understand that everyone has their own preferred way of working, and I appreciate when team environments respect those differences. For me, that means giving me space to work independently but also being available for collaboration when needed.</li>
            <li>Knowledge Sharing: I believe that a team works best when everyone shares what they’ve learned. I enjoy exchanging tips, resources, or strategies that can help others grow. When the team is open to learning from each other, everyone benefits.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="fun-fact">Fun Fact</h2>
        <p>I often like to challenge myself with side projects. Whether it&#39;s exploring a new API or building a small application for fun, these projects give me a chance to experiment with new technologies and sharpen my skills.</p>
