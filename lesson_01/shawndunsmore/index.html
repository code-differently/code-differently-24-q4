<h2> Introduction</h2>

Around 15 years uld I was instructed step by step to build my very first computer going over each parts functions to the computer which sparked my interests even more later through my years I took up a class for coding and wanted to learn about how languages are created and the origin of how they came to be. Im happy to be in this field and can't wait to fight through my struggles people want to give up but I want to win.</p>
