<h2>About Me</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="line"> </div>
<p>Originally born and raised in Springfield, Virginia I started my life in the DMV area.
 After moving to Delaware I eventually decided to go to a Vocational Tech School where I majored in carpentry.
I worked on woodworking projects including cabinets, framing, and roofing. I continued my studies in carpentry
for an additional 2 years before deciding on going to Delaware tech for College. I studied accounting for a time
 and received my associates degree. Afterwards I entered an adult learning  program where I learned HVAC.
I worked in this industry for the following 2 years before finding an interest in coding.

<h3>LEARNING STYLE</h3>
<div class="line"> </div>

    </div>

<p>I learn best in a social setting as I can bounce ideas across other people and receive feedback on my actions immediately.
 I also like to have a hands on approach on subjects and prefer getting my hands dirty with experiments and role-playing scenarios.
When I'm alone i like to reflect on the work that I have done and repeat challenge exercises to build up the mental repetition in my head.
I struggle to figure out how to tackle problems in the beginning but feel that it gets easier once I have built once I have a solid foundation
 to process my ideas.
