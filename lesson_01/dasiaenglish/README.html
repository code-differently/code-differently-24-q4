            <p>Hello everyone! I am excited to be in this program and further my education in tech. I graduated from the
                University
                of Delaware majoring in Entrepreneurship, and minored in Disability Studies. Not to mention I was on the
                Coed
                Cheer
                team and named captain my Senior year. I have 19 years of experience in cheerleading. With that
                experience,
                I
                also
                have won a lot of cool things in those years. My most recent accomplishment is being a 4x Collegiate
                Champion in
                a
                row.</p>

            <p></p>
            <li>
                When I am doing work I rather not get interrupted because I will lose my train of thought. I would
                    appreciate if
                    people would wait until I am finished to talk to me.
            </li>
            <li>Time management is big for me</li>
            <li>I have to be organized in order for me to be my most productive self

            <h1>What will get me talking </h1>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p></p>

            <li>I love talking about cheerleading. Like I said before I have been doing cheerleading since I was 3 years
                old. I
                have
                not stopped since. </li>
            <li>I enjoy talking about clothing and shopping. I have so many clothes. I love going to the mall. I also
                enjoy
                going to
                the mall. I did have to take a pause on shopping because I am starting to not have anywhere to put my
                clothes.
            </li>
            <li> I have torn my ACL and I love to relate to people in this way and give them encouragement on the 9
                month
                process. I
                know how it feels to have to take a step back from doing things how you normally do them and having to
                adapt
                to
                your
                new life. </li>
            <li> I also like to talk about cheerleading skills. I enjoy spreading my knowledge and helping people
                achieve
                skills
                that I already know. I get pride and joy from doing so. </li>
