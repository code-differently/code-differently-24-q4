        <h2 class="readme-heading">Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            I have lived in Delaware my entire life and have always had a love for tech. 
            In middle school I developed a passion for creating digital art and that love 
            grew throughout high school. When it came time for me to go to college, I 
            wanted to continue my artistic passions, but I knew I needed to persue a 
            profession with more lucrative job prospects. That's when I discovered frontend 
            development. To my surprise, this was an almost perfect blend of art and coding. 
            Despite being interested in the subject matter, I failed to set myself up for 
            immediate success post-grad. In order to be productive and pay bills, I took 
            up a job at my local Walmart. After making a few connections with coworkers 
            and customers alike, I had heard about opportunities at Code Differently.
            Now I am here, excited for the next 20 weeks, and really looking forward to 
            improving my technical and power skills.
        </p>
        <h2 class="readme-heading">Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Outside of work, I throroughly enjoy the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Video games</li>
            <li>Weightlifting</li>
            <li>Discovering new music</li>
            <li>Reading manga</li>
            <li>Watching anime</li>
            <li>Making YouTube videos and streaming</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="readme-heading">Communication Preferences</h2>
        <p>
            The best way to reach me is to send me a message via Google Chat. It has a nice 
            interface that allows for an easy transition between private messages, consolidated 
            text threads and group chats. I also try to look at my email pretty frequently. 
            If anyone were to struggle reaching me through those means. I always reply to 
            direct messages on Instagram.
        </p>
        <h2 class="readme-heading">Preferred Learning Style</h2>
        <p>
            I describe my learning style as a mix between visual and "trial by fire". Being 
            able to recieve visual clarification on a specific task really helps cement that 
            information in my brain. What I mean when I say "trial by fire" is that I like to 
            dive into topics, make mistakes at 100 mph and learn from them. It's almost like I 
            am brute forcing my learning but it's more like I enjoy owing the fact that I won't 
            understand a topic at the first go-around, but I won't let that deter me from moving 
            forward.
        </p>
        <h2 class="readme-heading">Best Working Time of Day</h2>
        <p>
            I am very much a night owl. I like the idea of being able to partake in deep learning 
            during peacful hours. I like to throw on some Bossa Nova jazz or some Native American 
            flute music and dial into whatever I am doing. Despite this preference, I still do 
            enjoy working during the day as it better allows for collaborations and Q `n' A's.
