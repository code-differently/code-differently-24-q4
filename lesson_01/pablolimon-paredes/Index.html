        <h2>A Bit Of Information About Me</h2>
    <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Curently my age is 22 years young, I was born and grew up in Delaware all my life, never really left unless it was to Maryland to visit family, however joining the military changed that for me. I graduated from glasgow high school during covid of 2020, and when I got my diploma it was similar to that of a drive thru unfortunately. This will be my first time ever coding so this will be a challenge but nothing I can't overcome.</p>
        
        <h2>Communication preferences</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Typically in person is best, however if you need to contact me next would be by email, or give me a call, usually the afternoon or anytime after 10 am would be a great time but by 8 pm i will get to you tomoorow.</p>

       <h2> The Way I Learn</h2>
       <div class="line"></div>

        <p>Everyone learns in many different ways, the way I learn is by hands on work, also depending on the type of information i can be visual, however I best find is the hands on. For me to keep it retained is by being repetitive with it since I will have to do it many many times to understand, but once the information starts to click i'm like a machine.</p>

        <h2> Military Information</h2>
        <div class="line"></div>

        <p>My MOS is 12 W, MOS is basically my job which is a carpentry and masonry specialist, I have been in for 5 years, joined when I was a junior in highschool and with the way that works is a split op program. The program allowed me to go to BCT (Basic Combat Training) in the summer before my senior year, then once you graduate you will complete AIT (Advanced Individual Training) which is the training that is your specific army job you have selected. I have done a few things in my time but the most memorable is in 2023 I was deployed to Saudi Arabia for 9 months which was an amazing experience, that truly showed me how different the world is in many different ways, how hot it is over there, the culture difference, and many other things, but it was all fascinating as well as an amazing experience.</p>
