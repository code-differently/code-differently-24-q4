    <h1>How to Work With Kimberlee Haldane</h1>
                  
    <h2><em>“Everybody is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.” - Albert Einstein </em></h2>
                   

    <h3>My working style:</h3>
    <p>I am <strong>NOT</strong> a morning person, however, I do what I need to do to get things done.
    I am the most creative at night, often getting lost in assignments, research, and learning when I should be sleeping.
    I like to plan out my work, breaking down what needs to be done, when, how, and what additional knowledge or tools I may need. I am also a big fan of "reviewing with fresh eyes", where I will set aside work (that has become frustrating) for 15 minutes or more, do something else, then return to the work. I find that this takes the pressure off and acts as a reset button for me.</p>
    <p>I like to try things first (with plenty of guidance from: videos, templates, instructions, etc...), just to see how I have interpreted the assignment. However, I will research, reach out, call, email, and send smoke signals if I need help.</p>
    
    <h3>What’s the best way to communicate with me?</h3>
    <p>The best way to communicate with me is through text message and email. I like explicit details and the ability to go back and reference or review instructions, which is much easier to do when they are written.</p>
    <p>If I don’t respond within 2 hours for email and 1 hour for text, something is wrong. I hate seeing the email and text message notification on my phone and I must check them to get rid of it.</p>
    <p>If you want to work on a project with me, I will always provide my availability and be mindful of your time. I will have lists of questions and tasks ready to go. This is not to take over the project, but my way of keeping myself organized and providing a starting point if one has not already been established.</p>
    
    <h3>I'd love to help you with ____</h3>
    <p>I have a wealth of knowledge on Curriculum, Instruction and Assessment, Research Methodology, English Literature and Language, and Instructional Design from the 12 years I spent as an educator in my past life.</p>
    <p>I am also well versed in random facts, have many create interests and hobbies, and am willing to share all my knowledge with everyone.</p>

                           
    <p>"If it is important to you, you will find a way. If not, you’ll find an excuse." – Ryan Blair</p>
                          

    <h3>What makes me grumpy?</h3>
    <p>I don't like being talked down to. Teach me, don't belittle me.</p>
    <p>Being late to anything ruins my day.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I like to give feedback?</h3>
    <p>I like to take my time to find the right words when giving feedback. I ask questions to understand the thought process that went into a person's output then try to make my feedback constructive. My rule is, if it is not going to help a person to improve or give them something to think about, it isn't constructive.</p>
    
    <h3>How do I like to receive feedback?</h3>
    <p>I like my feedback to be explicit and include ways to improve.</p>
    <p>I prefer a written document that I can go over before an in-person meeting. I like to take in the information, process it, work through any feelings they might invoke before meeting and talking about it. This helps me to get organized, ask questions, get clarification and take the feedback from a professional rather than emotional position.</p>
    
    <h3>One of my goals for the coming year:</h3>
    <p>One of my goals for the coming year is to be more assertive and not accept failure as a finality.</p>
    
    <h3>Topics I’m always happy to talk about:</h3>
    <p>I'm always happy to talk about anime, learning styles, cats, classic novels, poetry, K-Pop, Marvel vs. DC, Korean Dramas and baking.</p>
    
    <h3>Other things you might want to know:</h3>
    <p><em>"You know me, but you don't know me. I give you what I want to give you. I relate to villains like that - but I'm not out to destroy the world." - The Weeknd</em></p>
