<p>If I were to give you feedback, I think it is much easier in person. I like to first ask if you need any help with anything they are currently working on. After I am on the same page I will show what my works like and expalin how I got to where I am at and explain my thought process.</p>

<p>I like my feed back in person as well. I like to see a solution with an example to reference the problem I am having. I may ask for soecifics about how that process works so I completely understand and can concieve that solution later.</p>
