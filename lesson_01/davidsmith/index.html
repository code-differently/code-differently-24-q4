<h1>David Smith README.md</h1>
<br>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<hr>
<p>When I was younger I spent most of my life playing video games I was fascinated by creating a world in a game that could be whatever I wanted, something to look at and share with the world being able to say I made that. I came from a very poor area and am putting in the work to better my life for myself and my future family.</p>

    <li><p>C#</li></p>
    <li><p>C++</li></p>   
 </ul>

<h3>     Previous Frameworks Used</h3>

 </ul>

<h2> Past work</h2>
<hr>
<ul>
 <li><p>4 years at Code Differently I worked in the Youth Employment Program for the better part of 4 years, learning a variety of different coding languages and using multiple different frameworks.</li></p>

<li><p>Three, 8 week internships at JPMorgan Chase & Co. I would expand on the projects I've worked on unfortunately because of NDA's I cannot elaborate upon this but I used several in house frameworks and platforms including cloud platform, creating servers and api's used within the firm.</li></p>
 </ul>

<h2>The Way I Learn</h2>
<hr>    
    <p>I am a very hands on person. I dislike lectures but I understand why they're important because you're learning from someone elses experience and saving time rather than having to go through the experience yourself.</p>
