<h2 id="the-learning-style-">The Learning Style 👀</h2>
<hr>
<p><strong>The Positive Way</strong> 📈 I&#39;m a visual learner. The best way for me to retain information is by seeing a visual demonstration or example and then repetition of practice. </p>
<p><strong>The Negative Way</strong> 📉 Reading with out any direction of what i&#39;m doing makes it difficult to retain information. </p>
<h2 id="the-feedback-">The Feedback 🫵🏽</h2>
<hr>
<p>I prefer to receive direct feedback in a 1-on-1 setting. Don&#39;t hold any punches. Brute honesty motivates me. I may not like you in the moment but I&#39;ll appreciate it later.</p>
<p>On the otherhand, I tend to be soft when giving feedback. I can be very politically correct and try to protect feelings while still getting the point across. </p>
