   <h1><b>Nile Jackson's</b> README</h1>
 <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hi, my name is Nile Jackson. I started learning JavaScript about a month ago, and I'm about two weeks into my journey with Java; I'm new. I decided to learn programming because of my fascination with digital audio workstation plugins, I plan on building my own in due time. Before Code Differently, I worked primarily in juvenile detention; this wasn't fulfilling so a little over a year ago I rented a room in Brooklyn New York and began an audio engineering internship at a place called Jungle Studios. After two months at Jungle and several odd jobs I landed my first "gig" as the sound guy at a local bar called Skytown. I continued working small gigs for a few months and traveling back to Delaware 3 times a week to do carpentry work with a long time friend of mine. Eventually I decided that this life style wasn't sustainable, so after another four month internship at Manhattan Beach Studios, I did some research and discovered Code Differently.</p>

   <h3>Likes</h3>
<p>I enjoy cooking because I'm an eight year vegan who misses the dishes I grew up on, namely Jamaican food; I spend a lot of down time in the kitchen trying to "veganize" things. Other than food, I love to read, I hated books as a kid but four/five years ago I moved to Iowa to play(school) football at a small private college called William Penn, I wasn't a fan of Iowa or the school so I began using the library as a place to escape. I also like my two dogs, Pico(a Pitbull/Great dane mix) & LuLu(a small mut of some sort).</p>
 <h4>Dislikes</h4>

<h4>I'm not a fan of the following;</h4> 
<ul>
<li>Artichokes</li>

<li>English breakfast tea</li>

<li>The New York subway system</li>

<li>Excessively cold winters</li>
</ul> 

<h4>Hobbies</h4>
<p>Some of my hobbies include;</p>

<li>Various forms of exercise (force of habit from a life of sport)</li>

<li>Reading ( right now I'm reading a book called Cosmos and Psyche by Richard Tarnas)</li>

<li>Anime/manga (fav anime: Berserk, fav manga: Sakamoto Days)</li>

<li>Lounging/napping with my dogs pico and lulu</li>

<h3>My working/learning style:</h3> 

<p>Myers briggs says I'm an INTP. It usually takes me some time to open up to new people; peers/coworkers, but after that I'm pretty much an open book. I'm a visual learner who values repition. Professionally, I'm not sure what my style is, but I'm actively working on that.</p>  

   <h4>My circadian rhythm:</h4> 

   <p>I'm a night owl, but I'd like to change that, as most of my nights tend to spill into days. This is also a work in progress.</p> 

<h4>Why I value programming:</h4> 

<p>I'm sure this will change over time, but for now I'll say I value programming because it's empowering; I went to middle/high school for fine art because I loved making "something from nothing", and the idea of making a program stirs up that same feeling.</p> 

<h4>Moving forward:</h4> 

<p>I look forward to learning Github, Git, and Docker because I don't enjoy feeling confused. I also hope I can make myself an asset to the other members of my cohort because that would mean that I have a clue as to what's going on. My main goal here at Code Differently is to gain programming skills, get better at problem solving, build relationships, and get a job so I can get paid to learn.</p>
