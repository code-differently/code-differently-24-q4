## Homework

- [ ] Complete [Custom Data Types](#custom-data-types) assignment.
- [ ] Do pre-work for [lesson 17](/lesson_17/).

## Custom Data Types

For this assignment, you will need to pull together everything that you've learned up to this point to design and create your own data types. Again, remember to use the [Conventional Commits][conventional-commits] spec for your commit messages and pull requests.

1. Create a sub-folder in the main [app folder][lesson16-folder] with a unique name for your work.
2. Design at least one custom class that represents a real-world object.
    * The class must have at least 5 member variables of at least 3 different types. One of the member variables must be a collection type (Array, ArrayList, etc.).
    * You must also incorporate an enum type as well.
    * The class must have at least one constructor.
    * The class must have at least 3 member functions.
    * One of your functions must make use of a conditional expression.
    * One of your functions must make use of your collection member variable.
    * One of your functions must make use of a loop.
    * You must use at least one custom exception.
3. Create a matching subfolder in the [test folder][test-folder] and a test file. Your test must include at least 5 test methods.
