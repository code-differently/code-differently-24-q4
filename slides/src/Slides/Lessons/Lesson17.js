                <p><em>OOP</em> is a coding pattern that involves designing objects that model real world concepts</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>In OOP land, everything is an <em>object</em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>An object is a combination of <em><i>data</i></em> and <em><i>behavior</i></em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>This process of modeling concepts as objects with data and behavior is called <em>abstraction</em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><em>Encapsulation</em> is why we encode <i>data</i> and <i>behavior</i> in <em>classes</em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>It's also why we control whether things are <em>public</em> or <em>private</em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>We control what others are able <em>to know</em> and <em>to do</em> with our classes, hiding what we need to and exposing the rest.</p>

            <section>
                <p>A few principles are at work here</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Firstly, a <code>Truck</code> is a truck, but can be treated like any other <code>Car</code> (since it is a car). This is what we call <em>polymorphism</em></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p><em>poly</em> = multiple, <em>morph</em> = form</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>A object can take multiple forms</p>
            </section>
            <${CodeSlide} lang="java">
${`
Truck truck = new Truck("Ford", "F-150", new EcoBoostEngine());
Car car = new Truck("Nissan", "Titan Pro", new HybridEngine());
car = truck;
`}
            <//>
            <section>
                <p>Secondly, remember that we don't like to change code</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>This is partly what the <em>O</em> in <em>SOLID</em> is all about. We want objects to be <em><i>open for extension</i></em>, and <em><i>closed for modification</i></em>.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Instead of <em>modifying</em> <code>Car</code> to support Truck functionality, we made a new class for <code>Truck</code> that <em>extends</em> the <code>Car</code></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>Lastly, notice that we moved the <em>openTailGate</em> from the <code>Car</code> class to the <code>Truck</code>.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>This was a good move according to the <emm>L</emm> in <em>SOLID</em> (the <i>Liskov Substitution Principle</i>)</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>If all cars can't have a tailgate, then not all <em>subclasses</em> of <code>Car</code> would be substitutable for a <code>Car</code></p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>We wouldn't be able to make a <em><code>RaceCar</code></em> that extends a <code>Car</code> since they (usually) don't have tailgates.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <p>There are other tools we also have at our disposal as well</p>

                <h3 style=${{"font-size": ".9em"}}>Abstract Classes</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Abstract classes</em> help us to provide base implementations for methods and variables that subclasses can use, promoting <em>DRY</em> code</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section class="ml-bullet-slide">
                <h3>Single Responsibility (<em>S</em>OLID)</h3>
                <ol start="2" style=${{"font-size": ".9em"}}>
                    <li>Classes shouldn't do too much. They should only have <i>one reason to change</i>.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section class="ml-bullet-slide">
                <h3>Open/Closed (S<em>O</em>LID)</h3>
                <ol start="3" style=${{"font-size": ".9em"}}>
                    <li>Because we don't like changing code, we want our classes to be <em>open for extension</em> and <em>closed for modification</em>. It's better to add code to support new functionality than changing it.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section class="ml-bullet-slide">
                <h3>Liskov Substitution (SO<em>L</em>ID)</h3>
                <ol start="4" style=${{"font-size": ".9em"}}>
                    <li>When designing a class or interface, make sure it only has things that all subclasses will support so that all they are <em>substitutable</em> (don't add a fly() method to a Bird class if not all birds fly).</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section class="ml-bullet-slide">
                <h3>Interface segregation (SOL<em>I</em>D)</h3>
                <ol start="5" style=${{"font-size": ".9em"}}>
                    <li>The interface segregation principle is like the Liskov substitution principle, but for interfaces. Basically, <em>don't put stuff</em> into interfaces that not all implementers will use or need.</li>
                </ol>
            </section>
            <section class="ml-bullet-slide">
                <h3>Dependency inversion (SOLI<em>D</em>)</h3>
                <ol start="6" style=${{"font-size": ".85em"}}>
                    <li>When creating classes, prefer to make them receive their dependencies to make it easier to swap them out. <br />
                    Ex: Make Car builders give it the engine instead of making them get cars with an Engine already in it).</li>
                </ol>
